# Summary
- You can put arrays into state, but you can't change them.
- Instead of mutating an array, create a *new* version of it, and update the state to it.
- You can use `[...arr, newItem]` array spread syntax to create arrays with new items.
- You can use `filter()` and `map()` to create new arrays with filtered or transformed items.
- You can use Immer to keep your code concise.
